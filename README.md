# Containers and OpenShift Workshop

Welcome to this workshop on containers and OpenShift! Today, we will use an RHEL9 machine with Podman and a hosted OCP environment provided by your instructor, along with these instructions, as we journey from simple Linux containers to advanced container orchestration using Red Hat OpenShift.

Begin by following the instructions provided by your workshop instructor, or use the SSH command and password provided to log in to the bastion host from your local terminal.

```bash
ssh student@<WORKSHOP_BASTION_HOST>
```

Now, you are ready to begin the first workshop module. Continue with [Container Fundamentals](/container-fundamentals.md) now.
