# Containers and OpenShift Workshop

Welcome to this workshop on containers and OpenShift! Today, we will use a hosted OCP environment provided by your instructor, along with these instructions, as we journey from simple Linux containers to advanced container orchestration using Red Hat OpenShift.

 Let's begin by logging into the environment provided by your instructors and going to OpenShift Dev Spaces.
