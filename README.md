# Containers and OpenShift Workshop

Welcome to this workshop on containers and OpenShift! Today, we will use an RHEL9 machine with Podman and a hosted OCP environment provided by your instructor, along with these instructions, as we journey from simple Linux containers to advanced container orchestration using Red Hat OpenShift.

Begin by following these [instructions](https://showroom-showroom-qwcgm.apps.shared-410.openshift.redhatworkshops.io/), or use the SSH command and password provided to log in to the bastion host from your local terminal.

<!-- TODO Update this URL -->
```bash
ssh student@rhel9.qwcgm.sandbox557.opentlc.com
```


Now, you are ready to begin the first workshop module. Continue with [Container Fundamentals](/container-fundamentals.md) now.
