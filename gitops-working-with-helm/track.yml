  ## Goal

  This scenario will get you get familiar with how to use Argo CD to deploy
  Helm charts.


  ## Concepts

  [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes
  applications. You can define, install, and update your pre-packaged
  applications. This is a way to bundle up, and deliver prebuilt Kubernetes
  applications.

  [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

  Using Argo CD, you can still use your Helm charts to deploy and manage your Applications.

  ## Use case

  This is a simple guide that takes you through the following steps:

  * Use the native Helm integration in Argo CD
  * Explore a more GitOps friendly approach to Helm chart deployments
